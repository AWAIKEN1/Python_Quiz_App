Basic Quiz App
Overview
This Basic Quiz App is a simple Python application designed to demonstrate fundamental Python programming skills and the use of JSON for data storage. It reads a series of quiz questions from a JSON file and prints each question's text. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand basic data handling in Python, JSON parsing, and control structures.

Features
JSON Data Handling: The app showcases how to read and parse data from a JSON file in Python.
Control Flow: Demonstrates the use of loops for iterating over data structures.
Data Structures: Utilizes lists and dictionaries, showing how to access data within them.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Installation and Setup
Clone or Download the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Or download the ZIP file.
Navigate to the Directory:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the project is saved.
Ensure you have the JSON File:

Ensure questions.json is in the same directory as your Python script.
Usage
Running the Program:

In the terminal, run python quiz_app.py (replace quiz_app.py with your Python script's filename).
Interacting with the Quiz:

The program will print out each question from the JSON file to the console.
Currently, the app is set up for displaying questions. Interactive answering functionality can be added in future versions.
JSON File Format
The quiz data should be in a file named questions.json with the following format:

json
Copy code
[
    {
        "question_text": "Sample Question?",
        "alternatives": ["Option1", "Option2", "Option3"],
        "correct_answer": 1
    },
    ...
]
question_text is a string containing the question.
alternatives is a list of answer options.
correct_answer is the index (starting from 1) of the correct answer in the alternatives list.
Future Enhancements
User Interaction: Implement functionality for users to select an answer and receive feedback.
Scoring System: Keep track of the user's score throughout the quiz.
Time Limit: Introduce a time limit for each question.
